<h2 align="center">Notes</h2>

<br>

* Most endpoints haven't been tested.
* The user-agent header for android is `Crunchyroll/{apk_version} Android/{android_os_version} okhttp/{latest_okhttp_4.x_version}`.
* I might've missed a few endpoints or incorrectly documented them, so if you know of one that isn't here or see one that's missing something please create a PR.
* `https://wwww.crunchyroll.com` and `https://beta-api.crunchyroll.com` should be treated as the same url.
* Need help? Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/9YV8rH2ntz">discord server</a> and open a ticket, and I'll see what I can do to help.

* [Skylot](https://github.com/skylot/), without JADX this project would've been a hundred-fold harder if not impossible.

<h2 align="center">TODO</h2>

<br>

* Create a tool to dump endpoints and the respective data needed.
* A better format for documentation.
